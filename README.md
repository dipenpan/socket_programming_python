# socket_programming_python

This project demonstrates basic socket programming concepts using Python. It includes both **TCP** and **UDP** server and client programs that allow communication between the server and client.

## Files
- `server.py`: Server code that handles client connections and processes requests.
- `client.py`: Client code that connects to the server, sends requests, and displays responses.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x or above
- No additional libraries are required. The built-in `socket` library is used.
